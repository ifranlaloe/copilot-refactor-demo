alright here's something new I'd like to try. 
I'd like to download every documentation page of the Camunda 7 manual and save the main content as text files for offline reference and context use.

The Camunda manual website has a menu frame on the left side containing the Table of Contents (ToC), and the main documentation content is displayed in the middle div. I am only interested in the information in this main content area (the div with class "container-fluid").

As of now, the latest version is 7.23: https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.23

Requirements:
- Create a folder camunda-documentation to work in
- Scrape every chapter (e.g., Introduction, User Guide) and all of their subchapters, ensuring that for each subchapter, the scraper fetches its own page and extracts only the main content from the `.container-fluid` div.
- For each chapter, create a single text file (e.g., `1.Introduction.txt`) containing the content of the chapter and all its subchapters, in order. Each subchapter's content should be preceded by a heading (e.g., `#Download`).
- The scraper must avoid including navigation, repeated blocks, or unwanted elements (such as sidebars, headers, footers, or edit links) in the output. Only the visible documentation content should be included.
- For each subchapter, extract only the content specific to that subchapter (not the parent or navigation), by finding the heading that matches the subchapter title and collecting all relevant content until the next heading of the same or higher level.
- Normalize URLs to avoid double prefixes and ensure correct page fetches for all subchapters.
- Clean up whitespace and remove any remaining non-content elements.
- Images can be ignored.
- Use an appropriate sleep between requests to avoid flooding the server.
- Add enough logging so the scraping process can be followed.
- Iterate and confirm yourself that the first chapters subchapter matches the content on this page: https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.23/introduction/downloading-camunda/

Example partial output (file: 1.Introduction.txt):

Introduction
Welcome to the Camunda Manual! Camunda is a Java-based framework supporting BPMN ...

#Download
<content of the Download subchapter>

#Licenses
<content of the Licenses subchapter>

...and so on for all subchapters.

The goal is to have one text file per chapter, each containing the full, clean content of that chapter and all its subchapters, matching what is visible on the documentation site for each page.
